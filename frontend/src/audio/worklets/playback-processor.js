// Playback worklet — a ring buffer living on the audio render thread.
//
// WHY A RING BUFFER
//
// The server sends audio much faster than the audio plays. A seven-second reply
// arrives in about one and a quarter seconds, in ~120 separate messages. So you
// cannot "play each chunk as it arrives" — you would be starting a new sound
// every ten milliseconds while the previous one is still going.
//
// Instead the chunks go into a fixed-size buffer as they arrive, and the audio
// hardware pulls samples out of it at a steady 24000 per second. Two pointers:
// `write` (where the next arriving sample goes) and `read` (where the next
// sample to play comes from). Both wrap around the end of the array — hence
// "ring". `read` and `write` can coincide when the buffer is empty or full, so
// `available` distinguishes the two states. If the buffer fills, `read` moves
// forward and the oldest samples are overwritten instead of blocking.
//
// WHY A WORKLET
//
// `process()` is called by the audio hardware itself, on a dedicated real-time
// thread, once per render quantum — currently about 5.3 ms at 24 kHz. It is not
// affected by React re-rendering, a slow network handler, or garbage collection
// on the main thread. That isolation is the whole point: audio that glitches
// whenever the UI is busy is unusable.
//
// PART 2 ADDITION — counting what was handed to the audio output.
//
// `played` counts samples handed from this buffer to the audio output. It is the
// best local proxy for what was heard and the basis of interruption handling:
// when the user talks over the model, the server needs that playback position,
// and only this thread knows it. How much arrived or was queued is a different,
// wrong number.
//
// Messages from the main thread:
//   { type: 'samples', payload: <ArrayBuffer of Int16> }  enqueue audio
//   { type: 'reset' }   zero the played counter (at the start of each response)
//   { type: 'flush' }   drop queued audio, reply { type: 'flushed', played }
